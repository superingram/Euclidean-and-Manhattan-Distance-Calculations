# Euclidean-and-Manhattan-Distance-Calculations
In this project, examples and comparisons of distance measures will be explored. Specifically, we will visually compare the Euclidean distance to the Manhattan distance measures. The application of distance measures has a multitude of uses in data science and is the foundation of many algorithms you'll be using such as Prinical Component Analysis.
